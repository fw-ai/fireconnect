 * Never exits non-zero and never writes to stderr on a bad payload: Claude Code
 * blanks the status line on failure and logs stderr to the debug log, so a
 * transient unreadable transcript would flicker the line away. Anything we
 * cannot render is simply omitted.

 * one, hence removeAllListeners first. Status line stderr goes to Claude Code's
 * debug log, so warnings are dropped rather than reprinted.
