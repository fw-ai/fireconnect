 * a hundredth of a cent at every magnitude, and the fixed width keeps a column
 * of costs aligned without any trimming rules.
 *
 * Three outcomes are deliberately distinct, because they mean different things:
 * exactly `0` is free and reads `0` with no decimals to imply a measurement;
 * a positive amount too small for four decimals reads as an exponent
 * (`4.0e-5`), never `0`, because that call did cost something; everything else
