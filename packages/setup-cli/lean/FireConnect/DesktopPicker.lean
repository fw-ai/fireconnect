Formal model of the pure-logic invariants in the Claude Desktop integration
(`lib/harnesses/claude-desktop/profile-lane.mjs` and `index.mjs`): the picker
pairing in `serverlessLineup`, the effort-rewrite closure in
`normalizeThinking`, the device-config backup/restore round trip, and the
two-lane exclusivity. `native_decide`/`decide` spot checks pin the constants.

/-! ## Pairing: one picker row per router, each with a unique catalog id

`serverlessLineup` walks the `-latest` routers, pairing each with the next
catalog id in the pool not used by an earlier row. The guarded bug (hit live):
the same catalog id on two rows renders two identical picker entries. The
draw-without-replacement model below takes one pool id per router.

def pairUp : List String → List String → List (String × String)
  | [], _ => []
  | _ :: _, [] => []
  | r :: rs, i :: ids => (r, i) :: pairUp rs ids

/-- Every assigned id comes from the pool. -/

/-! ## Effort rewrite closure

`normalizeThinking` maps UI effort spellings the Fireworks ladders do not
advertise (`xhigh`, `extended`) onto nearest supported levels. Invariant:
every rewrite target is a ladder level (a rewritten request cannot 400).
-/

def ladder : List String := ["low", "medium", "high", "max"]
def rewrites : List (String × String) := [("xhigh", "max"), ("extended", "high")]

    ∀ p ∈ rewrites, p.2 ∈ ladder := by decide

    ∀ p ∈ rewrites, ¬ p.1 ∈ ladder := by decide

/-! ## Device config backup/restore round trip

`on` rewrites four device keys in `claude_desktop_config.json` and snapshots
their prior values; `off` restores them. A repeat `on` must keep the ORIGINAL
snapshot (Bugbot round: recapturing from the already-rewritten config made
`off` restore FireConnect's own values).
-/

abbrev Config := String → Option String

def deviceKeys : List String :=
  ["modelCatalogEnabled", "catalogUrl", "modelPrefer1mContext", "defaultModelEffort"]

/-- Snapshot of the device keys (other keys read as `none`). -/
def backupOf (c : Config) : Config :=
  fun k => if k ∈ deviceKeys then c k else none

/-- Restore: device keys take the snapshot's value (present or absent); other
keys pass through untouched. -/
def restoreOf (saved c : Config) : Config :=
  fun k => if k ∈ deviceKeys then saved k else c k

/-- `off` returns the device keys to their pre-FireConnect values exactly. -/
