/-
Formal model of provider BYOK credential handling in
`lib/firerouter/core.mjs` (key shapes, resolution precedence) and
`lib/firerouter/flag.mjs` (header attach rules, no-throw behavior), plus the
OpenAI route predicate from `lib/fireworks/model-id.mjs`.

`classifyKey` transliterates the JS shape checks as one if/else chain, so the
"mislabeled keys never seat the wrong family" property falls out of the
branch order instead of needing prefix-transitivity lemmas. `firstShaped`
models the flag > global > env > stored-header walk. Attach rules are pure
`Bool` functions, so every safety property is plain boolean reasoning.
