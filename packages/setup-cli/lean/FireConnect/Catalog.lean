Abstract safety specification for the catalog id-set policy documented in
`lib/harness/catalog-refresh.mjs`.

This is not a refinement proof over the JavaScript implementations: the
adapters have different storage formats and id normalizers. Concrete
cross-harness tests independently assert the same no-duplicates and
selection-preservation properties against every adapter. This model proves
those properties for a first-occurrence-preserving normalization equivalent
to JavaScript's `[...new Set(ids)]` for a candidate id list.
